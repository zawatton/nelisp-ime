;; NeLisp.  Host Emacs provides both as native primitives (= subr in
;; src/fns.c) but standalone NeLisp has no `last' builtin, which
;; causes `(void-function last)' when `nelisp-asm-x86_64-reloc-*-here'
;; runs during `nelisp-cc-cons-construct' compile (= first manifest
;; entry whose `--emit-cons-make' triggers a `plt32' reloc fixup that
;; calls `(car (last relocs))').

;; Both gated with `fboundp' per memory note
;; `feedback_emacs_stub_unconditional_defun_clobber.md' so host Emacs
