;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 92 §92.b — freestanding pure-elisp AArch64 (arm64) macro
;; assembler for the AOT AOT compile chain, sibling of §92.a's
;; `lisp/nelisp-asm-x86_64.el'.
;;
;; This is intentionally separate from `src/nelisp-cc-arm64.el' (=
;; the Phase 7.x JIT backend with its SSA register allocator hooks +
;; cl-defstruct buffer).  The JIT side patches a single uint32 per
;; instruction into a vector held inside its codegen struct; the AOT
;; side builds a flat byte buffer that is later handed to Doc 91 ELF
;; writer / Doc 93 static linker.  The two use cases share no live
;; state — keeping them physically split avoids namespace pollution
;; and makes the §92.b spike self-contained, mirroring §92.a.
;;
;; AArch64 instruction encoding is fixed-width 4 bytes, little-endian
;; on Linux + macOS (= big-endian arm64 is OOS per Doc 92 §3.1).  The
;; word is computed by ORing a constant base with bit-field operand
;; shifts, then emitted as 4 LE bytes.
;;
;; Buffer abstraction (= mirrors §92.a):
