;;; nelisp-stdlib-equal.el --- cycle-safe `equal'  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 50 stage 5b — pure-elisp `equal' that handles self-referential
;; cons / circular lists / mutually recursive struct graphs without
;; the depth-bound stack walk the previous Rust impl used.
;;
;; Strategy (Doc 50 §3.5):
;;
;;   (equal A B) creates a fresh visited hash-table (eq-keyed) and
;;   delegates to `nelisp--equal-rec', which:
;;
;;     1. short-circuits via `nelisp--ref-eq' when A and B refer to
;;        the same allocation (= identity match — also satisfies
;;        the cycle case where both arms re-enter the same node);
;;     2. records each cons / vector / record node in `visited' on
;;        the way *down* and treats a re-entry as `t' (= "we're
;;        already comparing this node");
;;     3. falls back to value comparison (`nelisp--ref-eq' for atoms
;;        does the right thing because `eq' applies to integers /
;;        symbols / nil / t already).
;;
;; Hash-table is allocated only on the first heap-touched node — a
;; tight integer/symbol pair never allocates.  `make-hash-table' is
;; itself an elisp re-impl on top of records (Doc 50 stage 4f-1), so
;; this file is only loadable AFTER nelisp-stdlib-hash.el.
;;
;; The Rust dispatch arm `bi_equal' is shadowed by the elisp defun
;; below — function-cell override at load time, same pattern as the
;; hash-table family.

  "Value-compare two strings without recursing through `string='.

`string-equal' (= the user-facing `string=' alias) calls `equal'
on its normalised inputs, so dispatching back through `string='
from `nelisp--equal-rec' would loop.  Instead we use:

  1. `(eq A B)' — for the immutable `Sexp::Str' variant produced
     by the reader, the Rust `sexp_eq' arm returns value equality
     directly (no allocation identity check), so a literal-equal
     pair short-circuits here.
  2. Length + char-by-char `aref' fallback — handles
     `Sexp::MutStr' (= `copy-sequence' results) where Rust `eq' is
     identity-only.  Characters are fixnums; `eq' on them is
     pointwise value compare."
