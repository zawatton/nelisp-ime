;; Doc 49 Wave 7 — pure-elisp shims that fill the gap between the
;; nelisp standalone runtime and the Emacs batch-mode functions used by
;; `scripts/compile-elisp-objects.el'.
;;
;; Goal: `target/release/nelisp --batch -L lisp \
;;            -l scripts/compile-elisp-objects.el \
;;            -f compile-elisp-objects-emit-all'
;; runs without Emacs on the build host.
;;
;; This file is NOT embedded in `Env::new_global' (no Rust change).
;; It is loaded on-demand by `nelisp-cli-main' when --batch mode is
;; detected (see `nelisp-cli.el' batch-mode dispatcher).
;;
;; Coverage
;; --------
;;   process-environment  -- Emacs-style list of "VAR=VAL" strings.
;;   getenv / setenv      -- read/write process-environment entries.
;;   add-to-list          -- idempotent list prepend (used for load-path).
;;   make-directory       -- wrapper around the `nl-make-directory' primitive.
;;   system-name          -- hostname via HOSTNAME env var or "localhost".
;;   noninteractive       -- always t in batch mode.
;;   load-path            -- defvar'd to nil; populated by -L argv processing.
;;
;; Intentional omissions:
;;   cl-lib       -- already provided by the nelisp runtime.
;;   require/load -- already in nelisp-stdlib-misc.el.

;;; Code:

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 1. noninteractive — always t in batch mode.
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; `noninteractive' is a well-known Emacs global.  In NeLisp batch mode
;; we initialize it to t.  The `defvar' form only sets the default; we
;; force-set it to t afterwards so existing code using `noninteractive'
;; (= `(when noninteractive ...)') sees the right value even if it was
;; previously set to nil by the runtime's default.
(defvar noninteractive nil  ;; noqa: NeLisp builtin-compat
  "Non-nil during NeLisp batch-mode execution (Emacs compat).")

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 2. load-path — list of directories searched by `locate-library'.
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(defvar load-path nil
  "List of directories `require' / `load' search for files.
Populated by the `nelisp --batch -L DIR' CLI arguments before the
first `-l FILE' is processed.")

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 3. process-environment — Emacs-style list of \"VAR=VAL\" strings.
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(defvar process-environment nil
  "List of environment variable bindings, each a string \"VAR=VAL\".

In NeLisp batch mode this list is authoritative for `getenv' /
`setenv'.  The batch CLI pre-populates it from `--setenv VAR=VAL'

any `-l FILE'.")
