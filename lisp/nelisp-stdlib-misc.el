;;
;; Emacs 30 semantics over ordinary symbol values, measured against
;; Emacs 30.1 (2026-08-22).  There are no buffers in this runtime, so a
;; hook variable cannot have a value distinct per buffer: `add-hook' and
;; `remove-hook' accept LOCAL and IGNORE it.  This is a DOCUMENTED
;; DIVERGENCE from Emacs, not an oversight -- a silent no-op is the
;; honest choice precisely because the local/global split LOCAL exists
;; to select cannot exist here at all.  Emacs would instead call
;; `make-local-variable' on HOOK and splice a `t' marker into the new
;; buffer-local value (that marker is still handled below, because a
;; hand-built hook list can contain one even without buffer-locals).
;;
;; DEPTH ordering (`add-hook'): default depth 0; a plain (non-`t', non-
;; integer) DEPTH argument is Emacs's documented backward-compatibility
;; case and means 90.  Insertion keeps the hook's list sorted ascending
;; by depth; a NEW function at the same depth as an existing one goes
;; AFTER it when DEPTH is strictly positive and BEFORE it otherwise
;; (Emacs's own wording) -- which is why two `(add-hook 'h f)' calls at
;; the shared default depth 0 leave the most-recently-added function
;; FIRST.  Emacs does not store per-function depths in the hook's own
;; list value (there is no room: the list holds functions and, DEPTH-
;; blind, the `t' marker) -- they live in a private table, and neither
;; does this runtime: `nelisp--hook-depths' maps HOOK to an alist of
;; (FUNCTION . DEPTH).  A function already present in the hook's value
;; with no recorded depth (spliced in by hand, not via `add-hook') is
;; treated as depth 0, Emacs's own documented default.  Re-adding a
;; function that is already a member is a no-op -- notably, it does NOT
;; move the function to a newly-requested depth; `add-hook' checks
;; membership before it ever looks at DEPTH (measured: adding a function
;; at depth -10, then again at depth 50, leaves it exactly where the
;; first call put it).
;;
;; The `t' element (Emacs: "run the global value here too") is honored
;; even though it can only ever mean "run this same value again": with
;; no buffer-local/global split, a hook's own value doubles as its own
;; "global value".  Measured against Emacs 30.1 with a plain (non-
;; buffer-local) hook list containing `t': the first pass runs the list
;; once; each `t' met on the first pass triggers ONE re-run of the
;; WHOLE value from its start (fetched once and cached, then re-walked
;; -- not re-fetched -- on every subsequent `t'), and any `t' met DURING
;; that re-run is skipped rather than triggering a further expansion (or
;; this would never terminate).  `(fn1 t fn2 t)' therefore calls fn1
;; three times and fn2 three times, in the order fn1 fn1 fn2 fn2 fn1

;; map.el subset: map-elt / map-put! / map-delete / map-keys / map-values
;; / map-pairs / map-length / map-do / mapp, over alists, plists (Emacs
;; 27+ rule: a cons whose car is not itself a cons, i.e. not an alist
;; pair, is treated as a plist) and hash-tables.
;;
;; `map-put!' is the one place Emacs's own contract is NOT "always
;; mutate": measured against Emacs 30.1, `map-put!' on a PLAIN alist
;; VALUE (not a place `setf' can reassign) mutates in place -- via
;; `setcdr' on the matching pair -- only when KEY is already present.
;; Adding a NEW key to an alist means consing a new pair onto the
;; FRONT, which needs to replace the list's head; a bare function
;; cannot do that to its caller's variable, so Emacs signals
;; `map-not-inplace' rather than silently doing nothing (Emacs's own
;; docstring: "If it cannot [modify MAP in place], it signals the
;; `map-not-inplace' error.  To insert an element without modifying
;; MAP, use `map-insert'.").  A PLIST is different: a new key/value
;; pair can be NCONC'd onto the END of the existing cons chain, which
;; mutates the last cons's cdr and needs no new head -- so `map-put!'
;; on a plist never signals for a new key.  A hash-table always mutates
;; via `puthash' and never signals.  `map-put!' returns VALUE (the
;; third argument) in every non-signaling case -- not the map -- this
;; is Emacs's own documented return, not a shortcut taken here.
;;
;; `map-delete' is documented by Emacs itself as NOT reliably
;; destructive for a list-backed map: "if MAP is a list ... and you're
;; deleting the [element that empties it, e.g. the sole/first element],
;; the list isn't actually destructively modified ... So if you're
;; using this on a list, you have to say (setq map (map-delete map
;; key))".  This implementation takes Emacs at its documented word
;; instead of chasing the partial, position-dependent in-place splicing
;; its C-free `defun' does for other cases: alist/plist deletion here
;; always returns a new list and never mutates the original cons chain.
;; Every well-behaved caller was already going to reassign from the
;; return value per Emacs's own advice, so this is a documented
;; narrowing, not a functional gap.  Hash-table deletion mutates via
;; `remhash' and returns the (same) table, matching Emacs exactly.
