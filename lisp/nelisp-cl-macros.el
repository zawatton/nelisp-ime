;;; nelisp-cl-macros.el --- cl-loop / cl-block / cl-return elisp impl  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Rust-min: cl-loop family を elisp 実装として stdlib に集約。
;; (= 各 consumer (nelisp-emacs / nelisp-cc / etc.) が独自の stub を
;; defun し合うのを止めて NeLisp 上流で共通実装を持つ。)
;;
;; 提供:
;;   cl-block NAME BODY...        catch+throw 経由の名前付き block
;;   cl-return-from NAME &optional VAL   block NAME を VAL で抜ける
;;   cl-return &optional VAL      最近接の unnamed block を VAL で抜ける
;;   cl-loop CLAUSES...           Common Lisp loop の subset
;;
;; cl-loop の対応 clause:
;;   for VAR in LIST                      list iterator
;;   for VAR on LIST                      tail iterator
;;   for VAR across VECTOR                vector iterator
;;   for VAR [from N] to|below|downto|above M [by S]   numeric iterator
;;   for VAR = INIT [then UPDATE]         stepped value
;;   with VAR = VAL                       binding
;;   repeat N                             counted iteration
;;   do FORM …                            unconditional side-effect
;;   collect / append / sum / count FORM  accumulators
;;   always FORM                          t unless FORM is ever nil
;;   when COND CLAUSE / unless COND CLAUSE  guard the clause that follows
;;   return FORM                          exit with FORM
;;   while COND                           continue while COND non-nil
;;   until COND                           continue until COND non-nil
;;   bodyless (= no for/with/do keyword)  infinite loop with cl-return
;;
;; Several `for' clauses run IN PARALLEL and the loop ends with the first
;; iterator that runs out, which is what CL does.  That was written once as
;; `nelisp-cl-macros--loop-build-parallel' and never wired up: the parser
;; kept one iterator, so a second `for' made the whole shape unrecognised
;; and -- see below -- unrecognised means nil.
;;
;; cl-loop は最終的に `cl-block nil (... while ...)' に展開され、
;; `cl-return' で抜ける。

Expanding to nil is what made this dangerous: a loop nobody could build
did not fail, it silently did not run, and 48 of the 62 `cl-loop' forms
in this repository were in that state at once -- including the AOT
compiler's stack-argument push loop, which therefore emitted nothing.
Every host test stayed green throughout, because the host has the real

vendor Elisp that merely CONTAINS an exotic loop still loads, and only a

Each SLOT is `SLOT-NAME' or `(SLOT-NAME DEFAULT)'.  Generated:

  - `make-NAME &rest ARGS' constructor (keyword form: `:slot value')
  - `copy-NAME REC'        shallow copier (option `:copier')
  - `NAME-SLOT REC'        accessor (one per slot)

Supported options:
  - `(:constructor nil)'    → suppress make-NAME generation
  - `(:constructor NAME)'   → rename make-NAME
  - `(:copier nil)'         → suppress copy-NAME generation
  - `(:copier NAME)'        → rename copy-NAME
  - `(:include PARENT)'     → inherit PARENT's slots (parent-first)

Slot index assignment: positional, in declaration order.  The
record's `type_tag' is NAME (a symbol); accessors call
`nelisp--record-ref' which is 0-based and excludes the tag — the
type tag is reachable via `nelisp--record-type'.

`:include' semantics: child slots come AFTER parent slots, so the
parent's accessor indices remain valid for the child record.  The
parent's predicate continues to satisfy child records via the
runtime chain walk in `nelisp-cl-macros--struct-isa'.

Limitations: no `:type', no `setf' integration, no docstring slot
form.

Note: `(declare ...)' metadata is intentionally omitted because the
NeLisp Rust evaluator does not yet strip declare forms from macro
bodies (= Stage 4 follow-up).  Indent / edebug specs come back when
`defmacro' grows declare-handling parity with host Emacs."
