;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 142 MVP command surface for NeLisp-private `.nelc' artifacts.
;; The first implementation stores a readable module payload with a
;; distinct magic header, plus a plist sidecar manifest.  Loading the
;; artifact replays the stored module init without reopening the
;; original `.el' source file.

;;; Code:

(require 'nelisp-load)
;; Doc 142 §6.1: eligible top-level `defun' bodies are precompiled to
;; NeLisp bytecode closures (`nelisp-bcl', from `nelisp-bytecode') and
;; replayed onto the NeLisp runtime function table; non-function /
;; unsupported top-level effects fall back to `nelisp-eval' replay.
(require 'nelisp-bytecode)
(require 'nelisp-eval)

;; Doc 193 §3: `nelisp-native-function-call' (defined below) is
;; `nl-condition's (Doc 168/169) flagship internal consumer, rewritten
;; onto `nl-restart-case'/`nl-handler-bind'.  This is a real, non-soft
;; dependency (unlike the `nl-check' require further down, which stays
;; optional because Doc 170 §10 says nothing may depend on it) -- but
;; it is NOT required here at file top level.  `require' needs
;; `packages/nl-prelude/src'/`packages/nl-condition/src' on `load-path',
;; and not every caller loads this file with those on `-L' (the
;; standalone build scripts under `scripts/nelisp-standalone-build.el'
;; pass `-L lisp -L src -L scripts' only) -- so, following
;; `src/nelisp-bootstrap.el's `nelisp-bootstrap--add-package-paths',
;; locating them needs a repo root.  Unlike that module (host-Emacs-
;; only), THIS file's `require' also has to succeed when the standalone
;; runtime interprets its OWN source (`nelisp-native-function-call' is
;; on the every-native-call hot path, so it runs both under host Emacs
;; AND self-hosted on `target/nelisp'), and `load-file-name'/
;; `buffer-file-name' are exactly the kind of host-Emacs-only
;; convenience that breaks there: under the standalone runtime they
;; resolve to NeLisp's OWN "value absent" sentinel rather than nil or a
;; `void-variable' signal, so `(or load-file-name buffer-file-name)'
;; silently hands `file-name-directory' a symbol instead of a string
;; (measured: `wrong-type-argument: (stringp nelisp--unbound-marker)',
;; reproduced with plain `target/nelisp --load lisp/nelisp-artifact.el').
;; `nelisp-artifact--native-compiler-candidates' below already solved
;; this exact problem for locating `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el'
;; standalone: `nelisp-artifact-standalone-repo-root' (baked in by the
;; standalone build) / `NELISP_ROOT' / `default-directory', never
;; `load-file-name'.  `nelisp-native--ensure-condition' (defined next
;; to the call site, near `nelisp-native-function-call') mirrors that
;; same root list, and -- also unlike the top-level `require' this
;; replaces -- runs LAZILY, on first call, not at file load time: this
;; file's own `defun' bodies are not macroexpanded until they run (the
;; same repro above still loads cleanly with dangling
;; `nl-restart-case'/`nl-handler-bind' references, proving the
;; standalone loader treats them as inert until called), so the
;; dependency only needs to resolve by the time the ladder actually
;; dispatches, which is also the earliest point `default-directory' is
;; guaranteed to mean anything.
;; Loaded lazily by the §6.4 native lane; declared so the bytecode/nelc
;; path does not pull the (heavy) AOT compiler at require time.

loader with a bytecode substrate, and a loader without one has nothing
left to install -- it can only fail the whole artifact.  Whether the
native section is usable is a property of the LOADER, not of this
compile: an embedder resolves the extern symbols the section names
against its own runtime and declines the whole section when it cannot
(measured: a consumer whose allowlist holds 7 runtime externs refused a
section naming 33, so all 21 natively-compiled defuns arrived with no
installable lane and replay signaled \"no native or BCL replay path\").
The compiler cannot predict that answer, so it appends the fourth
element the format already allows -- `(:fn NAME BCL SOURCE-DEFUN)' --
and every loader keeps a lane it can take: native, then bytecode, then
evaluating the recorded defun.  Costs the printed source of each

Where the result goes depends on what PATH is, and the two cases have

PATH with a directory component is a real target -- an artifact or its
manifest.  Its temp is the staging or backup file that `rename-file' later
moves onto that target, and a rename is only atomic within one filesystem, so
the temp has to stay in the target's directory.

PATH that is a bare name -- `neln-obj', `neln-probe', `nelisp-host-helper',
`nelisp-win-env', `nelisp-native-helper' -- has no target to stay beside.
`file-name-directory' answers nil for those, which `expand-file-name' resolved
against `default-directory': compile
artifacts from inside a checkout and the object files and helper logs landed
beside the sources.  They are deleted on the way out, so what survived came
from runs that did not get there -- one of them reached a commit and sat in
the tree until 2026-08-21.  Nothing renames these, so nothing keeps them on a

was, at some point in this process, installed as a native wrapper by
`nelisp-artifact--install-native-functions', so some caller may already
hold a direct call to the native code SYMBOL had at that time, and
redefining SYMBOL now cannot reach that caller.

This answers Doc 191 Phase 2's question for the one Hazard B source a
running process can actually query: `nelisp-artifact--install-native-
functions', the native-wrapper install path used when loading a `.neln'
artifact into a running `nelisp-eval'-hosted process.  It does NOT cover
the standalone build's own separate hand-curated compile-unit table
\(`scripts/nelisp-standalone-build.el''s `nelisp-standalone--manifest' and
friends): that is build-time-only data inside the `nelisp-standalone-
build.el' Emacs process that BUILDS a freestanding binary, with no handle
any running process -- Emacs-hosted or the freestanding binary itself --
can query at runtime.  Making that branch queryable would mean the
standalone build baking its own compile-unit provenance into the binary
as new, permanent, queryable state, which is new machinery Doc 191 §3
says not to build without it earning its way in; recorded here as an
explicitly bigger follow-on, not silently dropped.

This predicate is per-SYMBOL, matching Doc 191 §4's own sketch, not
per-CALLER: it does not distinguish \"early-bound for THIS caller\" from
\"early-bound for some caller, unknown which\" -- Doc 191 §6's third open
question (symbol-scoped vs. process-lifetime-scoped) is still open.  This
answers the narrower, symbol-scoped question Doc 191 §5's own Phase 2 ERT

fallback) are the SAME named restarts the docstring for `nl-condition'
uses as its own motivating example -- `fast-simple-abi' is tried
implicitly as the protected form, `general-native' recovers from its
failure, `interpreted-fallback' recovers from either native tier
failing.  Dispatch-report bookkeeping (`nelisp-artifact--note-native-
dispatch') is a side effect of which branch actually returns a value,
not hand-threaded through three nested `condition-case' arms as it was
before this rewrite -- see the differential corpus in
`test/nelisp-artifact-test.el' (\"ladder-*\" tests) for the behavioral
equivalence proof this rewrite is held to."

Signal when a finding in `nelisp-artifact-check-kinds' is present.

This is the same check `make compile' runs, called from the one place
every artifact passes through, so `nelc' and `neln' and the runtime
image are all downstream of it rather than each carrying its own copy.
Reimplementing the checks per backend is how backends drift apart.

`nl-check' is reached through `fboundp' rather than `require': Doc 170
section 10 has it depended on by nobody, and a hard dependency from the
core would invert that.  With the package absent this is a no-op, which
is also what makes the checks removable at all -- Doc 170 section 9
wants the disabled build to emit identical code, and a call that never
happens cannot change what is emitted."

Extracts the ET_REL object from ARTIFACT-PATH's `:native' section, links
it with a generated integer-ABI driver, runs it with integer ARGS, and
returns the int64 result.  This is the first native-execution spike: it
works for the reloc-free leaf functions AOT emits today (plain C
integer ABI, no boundary slots).  The host C toolchain (cc + objcopy)
acts as the loader; an in-process standalone mmap+reloc loader for the
general boundary-ABI case is the remaining §6.4 work.

Signals an error when the toolchain is missing, the artifact has no

failure mode instead of a clear error.  `preferred' means host Emacs is used
when available, but the native standalone path may still run otherwise.

NOTE: this used to also gate on `(file-exists-p (expand-file-name

sanity check that the baked repo root really points at a live checkout.  On

`file-exists-p' (built on `nelisp--syscall-stat', a separate, deeper
interpreter/syscall defect out of scope here -- see the
`handoff/syscall-stat-hang' investigation) returns nil for this exact file
even though it demonstrably exists, so `mode' always came out nil and the
native path ran unguarded.  `nelisp-artifact--standalone-runtime-p' already
requires a non-empty baked `nelisp-artifact-standalone-repo-root'; if that root
somehow does not point at a live checkout, the host-helper subprocess's own
`require\\='nelisp-artifact' will fail with a nonzero exit status, which
