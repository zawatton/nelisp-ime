;;; nelisp-ns-check.el --- namespace boundaries as a gate -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Runs the `nl-ns' checker over a small set of files and reports the
;; result through the gate contract, so that "my package names are
;; clean" becomes something a machine asserts rather than something an
;; author believes.
;;
;; Elisp has one obarray, so a second definition of a name silently
;; wins.  `nl-ns' reads files and reports where boundaries that the
;; language cannot enforce have been crossed; this wrapper picks which
;; of those findings should stop a build.
;;
;; Two classes are reported but do not fail:
;;
;;   ns-shadows-host          shim modules do this deliberately
;;   ns-undeclared-dependency one finding per edge of the real
;;                            dependency graph — worth reading once,
;;                            useless as a threshold
;;
;; For the whole tree use `make ns-inventory', which ratchets against a
;; recorded baseline instead.  This wrapper is for a handful of files
;; that should simply be clean, such as a recipe skeleton.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   emacs --batch -Q -L packages/nl-prelude/src -L packages/nl-ns/src \
;;     -l tools/ai/nelisp-ns-check.el -f nelisp-ns-check-run FILE...
