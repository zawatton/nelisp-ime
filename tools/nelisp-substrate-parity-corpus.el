;;; nelisp-substrate-parity-corpus.el --- shared probe corpus for the substrate-parity gate  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Pure data, read by `tools/nelisp-substrate-parity.el' and never evaluated
;; directly by this file.  Each entry is (INDEX TAG FORM):
;;
;;   INDEX  a stable integer identity for the entry.  Ledger keys and
;;          findings name a form by this number, so once assigned an
;;          index is never reused for a different form -- add new entries
;;          at the end, at the next unused index, rather than renumbering.
;;   TAG    `shared' -- also run against host Emacs and compared to it;
;;          `standalone-only' -- run only across the NeLisp substrates,
;;          because the form probes a NeLisp-internal name or a behavior
;;          host Emacs has no reason to share.
;;   FORM   an Elisp form.  Every form here evaluates to 0 or 1 (never a
;;          raw value): the point of this corpus is cross-substrate
;;          identity checking, not measuring an interesting number, and a
;;          normalized boolean is exactly comparable everywhere a printer
;;          exists and exactly encodable in a process exit status where
;;          one does not (see the driver's bare-substrate fallback).
;;          Nondeterministic primitives (`emacs-pid', `random',
;;          `make-temp-name') are wrapped in a property check, never
;;          compared by raw value -- this is the exact shape of the
;;          regression this gate exists for: a primitive probed in one
;;          substrate and generalized to another.
