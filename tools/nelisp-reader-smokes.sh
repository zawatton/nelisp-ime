# Run the standalone-reader smoke targets, several at a time.
#
# Why parallel.  Measured on the ubuntu/30.1 lane of run 32931012524,
# `nelisp-ai.sh smokes' took 1269 seconds -- 21.2 of that lane's 60.6
# minutes, and the single largest step once gate-mutation is narrowed.
#
# They all read ./target/nelisp, and most of them rebuild it first.  The
# `standalone-reader' rule has no prerequisites and its target name is not
# the file it produces, so make can never see it as up to date: every
# invocation runs the full build.  Measured here, one smoke takes 26
# seconds of which 25 are that rebuild -- so the sequential gate spent the
# bulk of its 1269 seconds building the same binary 28 times over, from
# sources that do not change while it runs.
#
# Build it once, then pass `-o standalone-reader' so no worker rebuilds
# it (26s -> 1s per smoke, measured).  That is also what makes the
# parallel run safe: with every worker building, they collided on the
# output file --
#
#   Opening output file: Text file busy, .../target/nelisp
#   make[1]: *** [Makefile:421: standalone-reader] Error 255
#
# -- 13 of 28 targets, twice, and a serial pre-build did NOT fix it
# because the rule reruns regardless of what is already on disk.
#
# The mutation harness is unaffected: it invokes the individual smoke
# targets itself and relies on their rebuild, and never goes through here.
#
# Output is deliberately NOT interleaved: each target's log is captured
# whole and only printed if that target fails.  A parallel run that
# shuffles 28 streams together is unreadable exactly when you need to
# read it.

# variable AND inside the recipe shell, and even `export FOO' within a
# recipe leaves `env' without it.  Every gate then falls back to
# `./target/nelisp' instead of `./target/nelisp.exe' and the aggregate
# reports 41 failures of `Exec format error', which reads exactly like a

# (env -u NELISP_READER_DYNAMIC).  Each needs ./target/nelisp to BE its
# own variant while it runs, so they cannot share it with anything,
# including each other.  Measured: with all 41 in parallel these three
# were the only failures, `Text file busy' on the binary, while the other
# 38 passed against the default build.  They run serially, after the
# fan-out, so nobody is executing the binary while one of them replaces it.
#
# The other three -- prelude-test, repl-smoke, malformed-input-smoke --
# rebuild it too, and were NOT on this list because the guard below could
# not see them.  They reach the build through
# `-f nelisp-standalone-reader-{prelude,repl,malformed-input}-test', a
# driver that builds the reader itself, so grepping their recipe for the
# literal `nelisp-standalone-build-reader' finds nothing.  A guard with a
# false negative by construction: it reported "all clear" for exactly the
# targets it existed to catch.  On Windows the collision surfaces as
# `Opening output file: Permission denied, .../target/nelisp.exe'
# (`standalone-reader-prelude-test', 2026-08-30) rather than the
# `Text file busy' this comment describes -- same race, different OS
# wording.  The detection below now matches both spellings.
