;;; Commentary:

;; `check-parens' identifies where the reader stopped, which can be much later
;; than the form that needs a closing paren.  This package reports the form,
;; its name, its swallowed physical forms, and an indentation-derived repair.
;; It has no dependencies so it can also run on the standalone NeLisp runtime.

  "Return physical top-level form boundaries in the current buffer.

A top-level form begins with a `(' at column 0 that is not inside a
string or comment.  That alone is not enough, twice over:

- A data block can begin a line with `(' while nested inside a larger
  form.  This tree really does that, so requiring depth 0 matters.
- But a form that is MISSING a closer never returns the depth to 0, and
  the forms after it must still be found -- reporting only the first
  break in a file would defeat the purpose.

Both hold if a start is a column-0 `(' whose enclosing parens, if any,
were themselves opened at column 0.  A still-open column-0 paren means a
previous top-level form failed to close; anything opened deeper means we
are genuinely inside one."

The rule, and it is the whole design: when a line's indentation is no
deeper than a paren that is still open, that paren should already have
closed, and its closer belongs at the end of the previous significant
line.  Indentation is how the author said where the body ends, and a
missing closer leaves the reader with no other way to know which opener
was meant -- paren counting alone cannot tell.

Appending at the end of the form instead is not a repair.  It can make
the file parse while binding the following code into the wrong form,
which turns a loud error into a silent one.

When indentation gives no signal -- a one-liner, or nothing follows --
the closer goes at the end of the form and INFERRED is nil, so the
report can call the placement a guess."
