;; Phase 4 actor runtime.  Ships the actor data structure and the
;; public API:
;;
;;   `nelisp-spawn'    spawn an actor from a thunk built with
;;                     `nelisp-actor-lambda'
;;   `nelisp-self'     currently executing actor
;;   `nelisp-send'     FIFO deliver a message to an actor
;;   `nelisp-receive'  macro — block until a message arrives
;;   `nelisp-yield'    macro — voluntarily yield to the scheduler
;;   `nelisp-actor-run-until-idle'   drain the run queue
;;   `nelisp-actor-start' / `stop'   drive the scheduler from an
;;                                   idle timer
;;   `nelisp-actor-list' / `nelisp-actor-stats'  diagnostics
;;
;; Phase 4.1 (fa304ed) shipped the primitive skeleton with a
;; run-to-completion mock-stub scheduler where empty receive returned
;; the symbol `timeout'.  Phase 4.2 replaces the scheduler with a
;; cooperative generator-driven loop: an actor thunk built via
;; `nelisp-actor-lambda' is CPS-transformed by `generator.el' so that
;; `nelisp-receive' and `nelisp-yield' truly suspend and later resume
;; from the same source position.
;;
;; See docs/design/10-phase4-actor.org §5 for runtime structure
;; (§5.3 locks the generator.el approach) and §2 for the locked
;; high-level decisions (A/D/B/A/B/B/A/A signoff 2026-04-24).

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
;; Doc 193 §4: `generator.el' is not vendored for the standalone
;; substrate -- §4.1/§4.3 re-verified that loading its real source hits
;; an unreduced reader bug (`void-variable: (declarations)'), and a
;; hand-port of its CPS transform risks a second implementation that
;; silently disagrees with the real one (the Doc 189 §1 `eql'/stdlib-
;; split story this doc cites as precedent for that exact risk).  A
;; hard `(require 'generator)' here made this package (and everything
;; that spawns an actor) unloadable standalone at all -- measured,
;; verbatim: `nelisp: uncaught error: file-missing: generator', running
;; `target/nelisp --load packages/nelisp-actor/src/nelisp-actor.el' on
;; a build with no other changes.
;;
;; Soft-require instead, and supply the runtime protocol a build-time-
;; CPS-transformed thunk actually calls (`iter-next'/`iter-close' from
;; `nelisp-actor--step' below, the `iter-end-of-sequence' condition it
;; catches) when the real library is not there to provide them --
;; nothing here reimplements `iter-lambda'/`iter-yield' or any part of
;; the CPS transform itself, only the four-name runtime surface real
;; `generator.el' also keeps this small (Doc 193 §4.2's own reading of
;; `scripts/nelisp-stdlib-prelude.el' notes the same thing: the parts
;; of this problem already worked out here are the macro-expansion
;; accommodations, not a generator runtime, because the runtime never
;; needed one to speak of).  `packages/nelisp-actor/scripts/nelisp-
;; actor-cps-dump.el' is the build-time transform (Doc 193 §4.4 Phase
;; 1): it runs under host Emacs, where `(featurep 'generator)' is
;; already true, so it always macroexpands against the REAL `iter-
;; lambda'/`iter-yield', never this fallback -- this shim exists only
;; to run the resulting closures, not to produce them.

  "Supervise CHILDREN-SPEC under a one-for-one restart strategy.

CHILDREN-SPEC is a list of plists, each describing one child:
  (:id TAG :start ACTOR-THUNK :restart POLICY)

TAG         identifies the child in restart events (any symbol).
ACTOR-THUNK is a closure produced by `nelisp-actor-lambda' — the
            same contract as `nelisp-spawn'.
POLICY      is one of:
  `:permanent' — always restart on termination (crash or normal exit)
  `:transient' — restart only on abnormal exit (`:crashed')
  `:temporary' — never restart

STRATEGY accepts `:one-for-one' only in Phase 4.5; other OTP
strategies (`:one-for-all' / `:rest-for-one') are §2.6 C scope and
land in later phases.

Returns the supervisor actor.  It spawns each child with
`:supervisor SELF' and `:restart-policy POLICY', then loops on its
own mailbox, pattern-matching `(:child-terminated ACTOR STATUS
ERR)' notifications from the scheduler crash hook and applying
POLICY.  Supervisor-crash-kills-children is not in Phase 4.5 MVP
scope per §2.6 B (orphaned children survive supervisor death);
adding that cascade is a v0.4.x extension."

  - Close wakes pending receivers with `(:closed)' and fails pending
