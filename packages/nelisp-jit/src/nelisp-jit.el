;;; Commentary:

;; Phase 3b.8a ships the minimal JIT.  Bcl (Phase 3b's bytecode VM)
;; remains as the semantic reference — this path is the performance
;; path.  The translator walks a NeLisp `lambda' form and emits an
;; equivalent host Elisp form, which `byte-compile' lowers to a host
;; closure.  A JIT closure has shape `(nelisp-jit HOST-LAMBDA)' and is
;; dispatched by `nelisp--apply' like any other callable.
;;
;; Scope after Phase 3b.8b:
;;   - top-level defuns AND captured-env closures (let-wrapped lambdas,
;;     partial application).  The captured values are embedded as a
;;     literal vector in the compiled constants pool and read via
;;     `aref' — see `nelisp-jit-try-compile-lambda'.
;;   - captured-env closures that MUTATE their captured variables via
;;     `setq' are rejected (return nil) so bcl / interpreter handle
;;     the counter-pattern.  The let-wrapped read form re-binds on
;;     every call, so mutation wouldn't survive across invocations.
;;   - inline primitives are emitted as direct host calls (see
;;     `nelisp-jit--inline-primitives').  User-defined functions and
;;     unknown symbols are dispatched through `nelisp--apply' so
;;     NeLisp-level redefinitions stay observable.
;;   - a known set of special forms gets per-form handling; anything
;;     else signals `nelisp-jit-unsupported' and the caller falls back.
;;
;; The opt-in is `nelisp-jit-enabled'; when set, `nelisp--make-closure'
;; tries the JIT before bcl compilation.

Default became t on 2026-08-16.  It was nil while the translation path
had never been run over the suite: the first full run with it on found
three semantic differences from the interpreter -- untranslated special
forms mistranslated as calls, and arity violations carrying the host's
error.  Those are fixed and both paths run in CI (`make test-jit' and
`make test-nojit'), which is what the default rests on.

Bind it nil around anything that asserts the interpreter's or bcl's own
representation; several tests do, and say why.")
