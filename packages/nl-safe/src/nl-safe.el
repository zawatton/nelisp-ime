;;   Fat pointer: [nl--ptr BASE LEN GENERATION]
;;
;; Raw-memory backend indirection: host Emacs has no raw memory, and
;; wiring to the standalone's raw-memory primitives (`alloc-bytes',
;; `ptr-read-u8', ...) is follow-up work.  Every actual memory access
;; goes through the funcall'able `nl-safe-ptr-backend'; the default
;; backend is a pure-Lisp mock (vector-backed) so the whole checking
;; layer is testable on host Emacs AND on the standalone binary.
;; Swapping in a raw-memory backend is the single integration point.
;;
;; Disable flag (Doc 170 section 9): when `nl-safe--enabled' is nil at
;; macro-expansion time, `nl-with-borrow' / `nl-with-borrow-mut' and
;; the pointer accessors expand to the plain unchecked forms, with no
;; residue of the checking layer.  Like `nl-strict', the flag only
;; takes effect for expansions performed after it is set: flip it at
;; top level (or around an explicit `eval' / `macroexpand'), not
;; inside an already-compiled function body.
;;
;; Design constraints:
;;   - pure Lisp, depends only on nl-prelude (Doc 168 section 4.1)
;;   - must run unchanged on `target/nelisp' standalone (no ert there;
;;     see test/nl-safe-standalone-smoke.el)
