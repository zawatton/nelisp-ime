;;; Commentary:

;; docs/design/185-cl-generic-subset.org's `cl-defgeneric'/`cl-defmethod'
;; subset: type + eql specializers, primary methods only plus
;; `cl-call-next-method'/`cl-next-method-p', a lazily-built per-generic
;; dispatch table, and a loud macroexpansion-time `error' for every
;; unsupported form.
;;
;; This is a real host-ERT test of the actual subset, not of host Emacs's
;; own `cl-generic': `(require 'nelisp-cl-macros)' loads
;; `lisp/nelisp-cl-macros.el', whose `cl-defstruct'/`cl-defgeneric'/
;; `cl-defmethod' are plain, UNCONDITIONAL `defmacro' forms (unlike most
;; of this project's stdlib polyfills, which are `(unless (fboundp ...)
;; ...)'-gated and therefore inert under host Emacs -- see
;; docs/design/188-buffer-unification.org §1.8).  Loading this file
;; unconditionally overwrites host Emacs's own autoloaded `cl-defgeneric'/
;; `cl-defmethod' for the rest of this batch process, so every test below
;; genuinely exercises Doc 185's subset, not real Emacs's `cl-generic.el'.
;; `scripts/nelisp-stdlib-prelude.el' carries an identical copy of this
;; same block for `target/nelisp' (the standalone binary) -- see that
;; file's own "cl-generic subset (Doc 185)" section; it does not load
;; under host Emacs at all (its own bootstrap `defmacro' redefinition
;; predates this addition and conflicts with host Emacs's macro
;; expansion from the file's very first form, confirmed on the
;; UNMODIFIED tree before this change), so its coverage is the
;; standalone-binary probe cited in the tests' commentary below instead
;; of an ERT case.
;;
;; Host-Emacs CONTROLS: several tests below cite an exact transcript
;; measured this session by running the equivalent form through real,
;; unmodified Emacs 30.1's own `cl-generic' (`(require 'cl-lib)', no
;; `nelisp-cl-macros' loaded) in a throwaway batch process -- confirming
;; both that the parity-comparable cases genuinely agree with real Emacs
;; (not just internally consistent) and, for `:around', that real Emacs
;; accepts what this subset deliberately, loudly rejects.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;; Force real Emacs's OWN `cl-lib'/`cl-macs' (cl-defstruct/cl-defgeneric/
;; cl-defmethod/cl-call-next-method/cl-next-method-p, all real, autoloaded
;; macros/functions) to finish loading COMPLETELY, right here, before
;; `nelisp-cl-macros' gets a chance to override any of those names.
;; Without this the override is not durable: `(require 'ert)' alone only
;; PRIMES the autoload placeholders -- a plain top-level `(symbol-function
;; 'cl-defstruct)' right after `(require 'nelisp-cl-macros)' already
;; shows this file's own interpreted macro -- but something in ERT's OWN
;; test-EXECUTION machinery (not its file-LOADING machinery: the
;; difference shows up only once a test body actually runs, never merely
;; from loading this file) forces the real `cl-macs.elc' to load AFTER
;; this file has already finished loading, and that load unconditionally
;; re-`defmacro's `cl-defstruct' back to real Emacs's own version --
;; silently.  Measured this session: the exact same `(symbol-function
;; 'cl-defstruct)' check, run from a plain top-level form, shows this
;; file's own interpreted macro; the identical check, run from inside a
;; running `ert-deftest' body, shows a byte-compiled closure carrying
;; real `cl-macs.el''s own docstring and struct-tag codegen instead.
;; Forcing the real load HERE, before this subset's own `(require
;; 'nelisp-cl-macros)', leaves nothing pending for that later mechanism
;; to trigger -- confirmed this session to make the override durable
;; through actual test execution, not merely through file loading.
(require 'cl-macs)

;; `nelisp-cl-macros''s `cl-defstruct' calls `nelisp--make-record'/
;; `nelisp--record-type'/`nelisp--record-ref', but nothing in this
;; module or its own load path defines them for host Emacs -- the one
;; existing host-compat shim, `lisp/nelisp-heap-image.el', backs them
;; with plain VECTORS instead of real Emacs `record' objects (for its
;; own heap-image serialization purposes, where nothing in that file's
;; own test suite calls `recordp' on the result -- confirmed by grep,
;; `test/nelisp-heap-image-test.el' never references `vectorp'/`recordp'/
;; `nelisp--make-record' directly).  A plain vector is never `recordp'
;; under host Emacs, so borrowing that shim here would make every struct
;; instance this file creates fail `cl-defstruct''s own generated
;; predicate AND `nelisp-cl-generic--type-match''s `(recordp val)' guard
;; -- exactly the struct-dispatch path this whole test file exists to
;; exercise.  Defining a REAL-`record'-backed version here instead (only
;; when nothing has defined it yet) keeps `recordp' host Emacs's own,
;; untouched, and gives this file's structs the same record identity
;; `cl-defstruct''s generated predicate/accessors already assume.
(unless (fboundp 'nelisp--make-record)
  (defun nelisp--make-record (type-tag &rest slots)
    (apply #'record type-tag slots))
  (defun nelisp--record-type (obj) (aref obj 0))
  (defun nelisp--record-ref (obj index) (aref obj (1+ index)))
  (defun nelisp--record-set (obj index value) (aset obj (1+ index) value)))

;; `nelisp-cl-macros' unconditionally `defmacro's/`defun's several names
;; real Emacs already owns (`cl-defstruct'/`setf'/`cl-loop'/`cl-block'/
;; `cl-return'/`cl-return-from') alongside Doc 185's own new ones
;; (`cl-defgeneric'/`cl-defmethod'/`cl-call-next-method'/`cl-next-
;; method-p').  `make test' loads every `test/*-test.el' into ONE shared
;; batch Emacs process, and leaving the FIRST group overridden for the
;; rest of that process breaks unrelated sibling files: measured this
;; session, `test/nelisp-daemon-test.el' failed to load ("Eager macro-
;; expansion failure: (error \"setf: unsupported place\"
;; nelisp-actor-status)") because `packages/nelisp-actor/src/
;; nelisp-actor.el' defines its `nelisp-actor' struct via real Emacs's
;; OWN `cl-defstruct' (it does not itself require `nelisp-cl-macros'),
;; and `nelisp-cl-macros''s own `setf' only recognises places its OWN
;; `cl-defstruct' registered in `nelisp-cl-macros--accessor-info' --
;; every struct from anywhere else in the shared process becomes an
;; "unsupported place" the moment its `setf' wins the race.
;;
;; So: snapshot BOTH real Emacs's versions and this subset's own
;; versions of every name below, restore real Emacs's immediately after
;; `require' (protecting sibling files from here on), and have
;; `nelisp-cl-generic-deftest' (a thin `ert-deftest' wrapper used for
;; every test below instead of bare `ert-deftest') temporarily re-`fset'
;; this subset's own versions for the exact dynamic extent of ONE test's
;; body, via `unwind-protect' -- so it does not matter whether a given
;; test's `cl-defstruct'/`cl-call-next-method' call was already resolved
;; at this file's own load time or is resolved lazily when the test
;; body actually runs (confirmed this session that both happen, for
;; different tests, depending on shape): either way, at the moment
;; anything in the body needs one of these names, it is this subset's
;; own.
