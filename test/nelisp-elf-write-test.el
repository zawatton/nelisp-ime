;; Doc 91 §91.a + §91.b + §91.c — pure-elisp ert tests for the
;; `nelisp-elf-write' module.  Exercises (1) byte/int conversion
;; helpers, (2) Ehdr + Phdr / Shdr / sym / rela serialisers in
;; isolation, (3) the `minimal-exit-0' + rich-plist orchestrators
;; end-to-end including `chmod +x' / exec smoke tests + `readelf'
;; cross-checks, and (4) the §91.c multi-PT_LOAD + .bss NOBITS
;; emission and the `hello-world-write' corpus #2 binary.

them and still trips the bound.

What the sample spread actually shows, measured across one CI run
(32956362867) with this helper in place, per attempt:

  macOS 30.1     ~0.0025 s     Windows 30.1   ~0.007 s
  macOS 29.4     ~1.1-2.2 s

That is a ~500x gap between Emacs 29.4 and 30.1 on the same runner
image, the same commit, the same run -- reproducible, not a stall.  An
earlier reading of this called the 7.57 sec a one-off runner hiccup and
put the true cost at ~5 ms; the 29.4 lane disproves that.  The bound is
therefore about 2.3x the real 29.4 cost, not the 1700x the fast lanes
suggest, so keep the attempts: on that lane this gate has ordinary
margin, not enormous margin.

Why 29.4 is ~500x slower here is not established and is worth its own
look; nothing in this file explains it."
