;;; Commentary:

;; ERT suite for Phase 5-D.1 — `src/nelisp-worker.el' and the
;; bundled child loop `src/nelisp-worker-child.el'.
;;
;; Coverage:
;;   - pool lifecycle: create initialises the 3 lanes; kill tears
;;     down every worker
;;   - `nelisp-worker-call' synchronous round-trip via pipe stdio
;;     returns the eval result
;;   - correlation-id assigns unique ids across rapid-fire calls
;;   - lane override works (:read / :write / :batch)
;;   - child-side error surfaces as `nelisp-worker-error' signal
;;   - wedged child (unreachable expression + short timeout) is
;;     surfaced as `nelisp-worker-timeout'
;;   - sequential calls reuse the same host process for the lane
;;   - stats plist reflects per-lane pool state + pending count
