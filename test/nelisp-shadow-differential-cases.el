;;; Commentary:

;; Expressions exercising names the standalone provides natively AND the
;; prelude redefines unconditionally, so loading the prelude replaces the
;; native implementation with an Elisp one.  `make
;; standalone-reader-shadow-smoke' evaluates this file twice -- once as-is,
;; once with the prelude loaded first -- and requires the two results to be
;; identical.
;;
;; Measured 2026-08-19: 70 of the 245 `shared-shadowing' names in
;; docs/emacs-compat-table.txt are also in the standalone's native builtin
;; list, and 10 of those are defined in the prelude, which is the set both
;; halves of a run can actually reach.  Nothing here diverged when the file
;; was written; the point is that it stays that way.
;;
;; The class is not hypothetical.  Three defects on 2026-08-19 were an
;; unconditional definition landing on a working one: `provide'/`featurep'
;; fset over the native builtins while `require' stayed native, a
;; `string-match-p' that recognised five literal regexps and answered nil to
;; everything else, and an `error-message-string' that dropped the error
;; symbol.  Each was found by hand, late, a long way from where it was
;; introduced.  A differential is how a machine finds the next one.
;;
;; When comparing this file's value against stock Emacs by hand, wrap it so
;; NeLisp prints through `format "%S"' as Emacs does:
;;
;;   (princ (format "%S\n" (progn <this file>)))
;;
;; Reading the runtime's own value echo instead compares Emacs's printer
;; against a DIFFERENT NeLisp printer -- the native `nelisp--repr' -- and
;; that one does not escape a backslash inside a nested string, so
;; (prin1-to-string (intern "12")) shows as "\\12" from one and "\\\\12"
;; from the other while the value is byte-identical.  An hour went into
;; that mirage on 2026-08-19.  The echo gap is a real divergence and is its
;; own item; it is just not what these cases are about.
;;
;; Add a case when a prelude definition starts covering more ground, and
;; keep every expression answerable by BOTH implementations -- an expression
;; only the prelude can evaluate proves nothing about agreement.
