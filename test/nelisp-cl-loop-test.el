;;; Commentary:

;; The standalone runtime ships its own `cl-loop' (an Elisp subset, in
;; `nelisp-cl-macros.el' and byte-identically in the prelude).  An
;; unrecognised clause shape expands to nil, so a loop that the subset
;; cannot model does not fail -- it silently does not run.  That is how
;; 48 of the tree's 62 `cl-loop' forms came to be dead on the standalone
;; while every host test stayed green: the host has the real macro.
;;
;; These tests close that gap the only way that means anything: every
;; case is evaluated twice, once through the subset's own expander and
;; once through the host's `cl-loop', and the two answers must be equal.
;; A shape the subset declines still expands to nil, and the comparison
;; holds it to that -- the host has to answer nil too.
