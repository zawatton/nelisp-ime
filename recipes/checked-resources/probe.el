;;; probe.el --- exercise and measure the checked-resources skeleton -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Run from the repository root:
;;
;;   nelisp --load recipes/checked-resources/probe.el              # behaviour
;;   PROBE_ARM=checked PROBE_ITERATIONS=4000 nelisp --load ...     # one timed arm
;;
;; The timing is done by the caller, not here, because the standalone
;; runtime has no usable clock: `(current-time)' answers `(0 0 0 0)' and
;; `(float-time)' answers nil.  So each timed arm is a whole process,
;; and `verify.sh' times it from outside and subtracts an empty run of
;; the same arm to remove start-up — the slope method this repository
;; already uses for its own benchmarks.
;;
;; PROBE_ARM selects what to do:
;;
;;   behaviour (default)  correctness + the borrow-violation corpus
;;   plain                PROBE_ITERATIONS unchecked sums, nothing else
;;   checked              PROBE_ITERATIONS borrow-checked sums
