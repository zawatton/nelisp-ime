# verify.sh --- prove the borrow discipline works, and measure what it costs
#               *here* instead of quoting someone else's number.
#
# The gate covers behaviour only:
#
#   1. a shared borrow reads the right value
#   2. an exclusive borrow taken while a shared one is live SIGNALS
#   3. the violation lands in the corpus the Phase 6 gate reads
#
# The overhead is measured by tools/ai/bench-compare.sh, which reports
# it under its own gate (bench-borrow-check) so that a number the
# machine invalidated cannot quietly become part of this recipe's
# verdict.  That harness runs each arm at n=0 and n=N and subtracts
# (the standalone runtime has no clock: `(current-time)' answers
# `(0 0 0 0)' and `(float-time)' answers nil), times the base arm twice
# to measure drift, and discards the ratio when the machine moved.
