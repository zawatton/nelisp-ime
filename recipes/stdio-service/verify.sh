# Run this before writing any code of your own.  A recipe that cannot
# pass its own smoke here is telling you something about the runtime, the
# binary in target/, or the platform — and it is much cheaper to learn
# that now than from a half-written service.
#
# Checks, in order:
#   1. every request gets exactly one response line
#   2. arithmetic crosses the wire intact
#   3. the documented end-of-stream marker arrives
#   4. responses are flushed as they are produced, not buffered to exit
#
# Check 4 is the one that decides whether this shape is usable for an
# interactive host at all.  It is measured, not assumed: the producer
# holds the pipe open for four seconds and the response must already be
# on disk two seconds in.
