;;; service.el --- a NeLisp stdio service, minimal but complete -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Protocol: one s-expression per line on stdin, one s-expression per
;; line on stdout.  Run it as:
;;
;;     nelisp --load service.el
;;
;; and not as `nelisp service.el': the positional form loads through a
;; leaner substrate where `string-search' is void, so the service dies
;; on its first line.  Measured, not assumed -- see PITFALLS.md.
;;
;; `--load' prints the loaded file's return value when it finishes, so
;; the stream always ends with one extra line.  Rather than fight that,
;; `service-main' returns `service-eof' and that extra line becomes the
;; documented end-of-stream marker.
;;
;; Why s-expressions rather than JSON: `read-from-string' is in the
;; standalone runtime and `json-encode' is not (it lives in the
;; nelisp-json package).  Framing requests as Lisp means no parser to
;; write and no dependency to load.
;;
;; Why lines rather than a length prefix: a line is what a host process
;; can write with `fprintf' and flush, and what a shell can generate in
;; a test.  Length prefixes are better once the payload can contain
;; newlines; at that point change `service-next-line' and nothing else.

(defun service--fill ()
  "Read one chunk from stdin.  Return nil at end of file.

`read-stdin-bytes' is the runtime's only stdin primitive: `read' here
supports string streams only, and `read-string' does not exist.  It
returns whatever the underlying read(2) produced, so a chunk boundary
can fall anywhere — including mid-line, which is why this function
appends to a buffer instead of returning the chunk."
