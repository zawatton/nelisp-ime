# nelisp runtime — known limitations

Living reference (snapshot: 2026-06-24).  These are the known constraints,
gaps, and approximations of the **nelisp runtime** — the native code emitted
by the AOT backend (and the standalone NeLisp interpreter) — that make
compiled C *not always behave identically to the same C built with a native
toolchain*.  This is the basis for the "honest scope" of downstream showcases
(e.g. C-to-nelisp demos): a function only behaves like its C original when it
avoids the items below.

Companion: [`design/142-native-exec-findings.md`](design/142-native-exec-findings.md)
(object-mode loader / hidden-boundary ABI).

Grouped A–E by impact on C-equivalence.  Each item cites a primary source.

---

## A. Host-environment dependence — two layers, don't conflate them

- **Compiled C reaches the host environment through ordinary extern libc
  calls, and gets REAL values.**  `time(0)`, `clock_gettime`, `getenv`,
  `rand`/`srand`, etc. are just `extern-call`s the linker resolves against
  libc, so a cfront-compiled function returns the real wall clock (NOT a 1970
  stub), reads the real environment, and runs the real RNG.  Verified:
  `nelisp-cfront-host-env-via-extern-libc-e2e` (in nelisp-cfront).  The only
  caveat is the universal one (§B): the symbols must be linked.
- **The nelisp ELISP interpreter's own host builtins are a separate,
  AOT-unimplemented layer** — this is what "no clock / 1970" refers to, and it
  does NOT constrain compiled C.  When the AOT'd *interpreter* evaluates elisp,
  there is no AOT grammar for `current-time` / `get-internal-run-time` /
  `random` (→ `src/nelisp-eval.el:765`), and the `getenv` *builtin* wiring is
  gated to Linux x86_64 (→ `lisp/nelisp-cc-bi-getenv.el:44, 151-153`).
- **No nested `extern-call` as a call argument.**  A nested external call must
  be hoisted to its own defun (to keep eval order well-defined).
  → `lisp/nelisp-cc-bi-getenv.el:104-105`.

## B. extern / libc calls are link-time dependencies (`.el` is not self-contained)

- AOT objects reference external symbols (`nl_alloc_symbol`, `strlen`, `sin`,
  …) and emit PLT32 relocations the linker MUST resolve; unresolved symbols
  fault at run time.  The emitted `.el`/`.o` alone does not run libc-dependent
  code — it must be linked.
  → `docs/design/142-native-exec-findings.md:16-29`,
    `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el:185-190`,
    `lisp/nelisp-cc-extern-call-f64.el:20-26`.

## C. Floating point (f64 / double) gaps

- **`double` arguments/returns through `extern-call` — SUPPORTED (2026-06-24).**
  cfront carries a `double` as i64 bits in a gp slot; an extern `double`
  argument is now bridged into its xmm register via `bits-to-f64` (MOVQ) and a
  `double` return is bridged back via `f64-bits` (`--emit-f64-bits` accepts an
  `extern-call` IR node with `:ret-class f64`).  This lets cfront call the
  standard-ABI libm (`sqrt`/`sin`/`pow`/`ldexp`, incl. mixed f64+int args).
  Regression test: `nelisp-cfront-float-extern-libm-e2e`.  (Note: cfront's own
  defined `double` functions still use the gp-bits ABI for their *own* params /
  return, so a C caller bit-casts across them — see that test's `B`/`U`.)
  **Still unsupported:** `va_arg` of a `double` (the fp_offset walk) — loud
  error.
- **`extern-call-f64` caps at 8 f64 args**; mixing f64 and integer args makes
  register scheduling complex and is staged.
  → `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el:136-140, 549-557`.
- **f64 arithmetic is x86_64 only** today; aarch64 is being migrated.  NaN
  comparisons follow IEEE-754 (always false / unordered).
  → `lisp/nelisp-cc-jit-float.el:28-30, 68-74`.

## D. syscall / memory / GC

- **syscall 6th argument (a5) is fixed to 0** (no 7-arg defun stack-slot
  support yet) → `mmap` with a non-zero `offset` is not expressible.
  **Raw syscalls are Linux x86_64 only.**
  → `lisp/nelisp-cc-jit-syscall-call.el:42-50, 56-57, 96`.
- **mmap allocator is 4096-byte granular**: small objects still consume a full
  page.  Mixing Rust-heap boxes with the mmap allocator risks `free`/`munmap`
  mismatch.
  → `lisp/nelisp-cc-alloc-mem.el:18-29, 51-58`.
- **GC root stack must be initialised** (`nl_rootstack_init`); before that the
  base pointer is 0 and `nl_gc_mark_rootstack` is silently skipped, which can
  produce incomplete marking.
  → `lisp/nelisp-cc-rootstack.el:19-23`.

## E. AOT grammar / ABI — staged support

- **Argument registers: 6 GP (rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9) + 8 FP (xmm0–7).**
  Functions beyond the register file use stack-passed slots with caps, and
  some argument-class shapes (mixed GP/FP on the stack) are only partially
  supported.  → `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el:136-140, 544-557`.
- **object-mode defuns require an 18-slot hidden-boundary block** after the
  parameters (`out`, `mirror`, `frames`, `scratch`, `name_slot`, callback
  slots 0–11); a loader that does not populate them gets undefined behaviour,
  and defun `:arity` / `:rt-slot-count` / `:body-offset` metadata must be
  accurate.  → `docs/design/142-native-exec-findings.md:36-58, 136-140`.
- **Dynamic binding of special variables in a runtime `let` is unsupported**
  (only statically-analysable bindings).  → `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el:175`.
- **Odd-arity stack-alignment double-correction — FIXED (2026-06-24).**  The
  prologue always rounds post-prologue rsp to 0 mod 16, so a call site's
  alignment depends only on the words that call itself pushes, NOT on the
  enclosing defun's arity.  Several `needs-align` formulas still added the
  arity, so an odd-arity caller reached a call site at rsp ≡ 8 mod 16 — latent
  because most libc callees tolerate it, but a SIGSEGV in SSE-heavy callees
  (e.g. `vsnprintf`).  All SysV paths were brought in line with the win64
  branch (which never added arity): `--emit-extern-call` (`needs-align` +
  `spill-needs-align`), `--emit-call` (both the ≤6-arg and 7+-arg stack
  paths), and `--emit-runtime-call-args`.  The now-unused
  `--current-defun-arity` readers were removed.
  → `lisp/nelisp-aot-compiler.el` (`--emit-call`, `--emit-extern-call`,
    `--emit-runtime-call-args`).  Regression test:
    `nelisp-cfront-odd-arity-stack-arg-extern-align-e2e`.

## F. Standalone Lisp raw-byte characters

- **Unibyte strings are represented and consumed as raw bytes, but a raw byte
  128–255 still cannot be represented as a character inside a multibyte
  string.**  `concat`, `format`, `vconcat`, and `append` signal
  `nelisp-raw-byte-unrepresentable` when such a conversion would be required;
  `string-to-multibyte` signals the same condition.  ASCII-only unibyte input
  remains freely mixable.  This is deliberate: silently treating a raw byte
  buffer as UTF-8 invents characters and was the pre-Doc-200 behaviour.
  Stock Emacs 30.1 represents such a byte `B` as raw-byte character
  `#x3FFF00 + B`; measured examples are
  `(append (concat (unibyte-string 200) "あ") nil)` →
  `(4194248 12354)`, `(append (string-to-multibyte (unibyte-string 200))
  nil)` → `(4194248)`, `(append "\310あ" nil)` → `(4194248 12354)`, and
  `(string-bytes (concat (unibyte-string 200) "あ"))` → `5`.  NeLisp has no
  representation for `4194248`, so signalling is the explicit scope refusal,
  not an approximation.  Primary implementation sources:
  `scripts/nelisp-standalone-build.el` (`bf_raw_byte_unrepresentable`, the
  `concat`/`format`/`string-to-multibyte` builtin arms) and
  `docs/design/200-unibyte-string-representation.org` (§4 implementation
  report).
- **String `aset` follows the stricter Emacs 31.1 fixed-width rule and
  deliberately differs from the Emacs 30.1 parity host in two cases.**
  Unibyte strings accept only values 0–255.  Multibyte strings mutate only
  when both the replaced and replacement characters are ASCII, keeping the
  exact Sexp tag and `string-bytes` unchanged.  Emacs 30.1 instead turns a
  copied `"あ"` into `"a"` and a copied `"ab"` into `"あb"`; NeLisp signals
  and leaves each string unchanged, matching the 31.1 rule quoted in Doc 200
  §2.  Primary implementation and executable assertions:
  `scripts/nelisp-standalone-build.el` (`bf_aset_unibyte_string`,
  `bf_aset_multibyte_string`),
  `lisp/nelisp-cc-evalport-nonenv-mut-str-set-cp.el`, and
  `test/nelisp-doc200-unibyte-repr-test.el`.

## Out of scope here (packaging / platform reach, not C-equivalence)

These appear in `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and concern build/platform reach rather
than runtime semantics of compiled C: Linux x86_64 is the CI blocker, arm64 is
best-effort, 32-bit ARM and Windows native (`--no-emacs`) are out of scope;
macOS notarization is a placeholder; the Japanese coding tables are partial
(~885 entries).  → `RELEASE_NOTES.md:36-50, 103, 105-106, 109-110`.

## Practical implication

For a compiled-C function to behave identically to native C it must: take no
time/RNG/env dependency (A), be linked against the libc/runtime symbols it
calls (B), avoid `double` across `extern`/`va_arg` (C), avoid the syscall/mmap
edges (D), and stay within the supported argument/ABI shapes (E).  Curated
showcases pick functions that satisfy all of the above and then verify their
output byte-for-byte against a native build.
