;;; Commentary:

;; Phase 3c ships a NeLisp-level object tracker.  Host Emacs GC still
;; owns memory reclamation — this module answers "which NeLisp values
;; are reachable from NeLisp roots?" rather than freeing anything.
;;
;; Purpose (see docs/design/09-phase3c-gc.org):
;;   1. Phase 4 actor boundary reachability (who owns what?)
;;   2. Finalizer hooks for host-GC-invisible resources
;;   3. Heap introspection for diagnostics / MCP
;;
;; Phase 3c.1 scope: skeleton + root set enumeration only.  Mark pass,
;; finalizer registry, MCP tools and actor boundary API land in
;; 3c.2-5.  No public GC API yet except `nelisp-gc-root-set'.
