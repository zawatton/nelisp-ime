;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 141 Stage 2: extract the loader's minimal file/path surface into
;; a core-only layer.  This file owns deterministic path surgery,
;; existence/readability probes, raw byte reads, and UTF-8 source-file
;; decoding.  Editor/buffer compatibility APIs remain outside core.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
;; Optional: this file is also loaded by the standalone runtime, which has no
;; Emacs underneath it to load `subr-x' from -- and does not need one.  Every
;; name the tree uses from it (string-empty-p, string-trim, string-blank-p,
;; when-let, if-let, hash-table-keys/-values) is already defined by the stdlib
;; prelude there; measured 2026-08-19, `fboundp' answers t for all of them in
;; the built reader.  A hard require asks for a file rather than for the
;; functions, and the file is the part that does not exist.
