;;; nelisp-integration.el --- Phase 7.5 cross-module wire-up helpers  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Phase 7.5.1 (Doc 32 v2 LOCKED 2026-04-25 §3.1) — partial.  Acts as a
;; central hub for the Phase 7.5 integration pieces that bridge the
;; allocator (T16 — bare-symbol family namespace) and the gc-inner
;; layer (T17 — keyword-prefixed family namespace) plus stubs for the
;; Phase 7.5.2 cold-init coordinator and Phase 7.5.3 release-artifact
;; verifier.
;;
;; Phase 7.5.2 (Doc 32 v2 LOCKED 2026-04-25 §3.2, this expansion) —
;; lifts the cold-init coordinator stub to a *real* implementation
;; that runs the Doc 28 §3.5 four-stage self-host bootstrap protocol
;; embedded inside a single process, plus a pre-flight verifier that
;; bin/anvil --strict-no-emacs uses to decide whether to drop the host
;; Emacs fallback.  The release-artifact verifier remains a stub for
;; Phase 7.5.3.
;;
;; Scope (Phase 7.5.1 partial, retained):
;;   - keyword family map (allocator bare ↔ gc-inner keyword) with
;;     bidirectional translation helpers + fallback for unknown
;;     family names.
;;   - cold-init coordinator stub (Phase 7.5.2 4-stage bootstrap).
;;   - release-artifact verifier stub (Phase 7.5.3 stage-d-v2.0
;;     binary checksum + symbol-presence check).
;;
;; Scope (Phase 7.5.2, this expansion):
;;   - `nelisp-integration-required-contract-versions' constant that
;;     records the heap-region registry (Doc 29 §1.4) and GC metadata
;;     wire (Doc 28 §6.10) contract versions the cold-init coordinator
;;     refuses to skew against.
;;   - `nelisp-integration-cold-init-verify' pre-flight check that
;;     bin/anvil --strict-no-emacs invokes before committing to the
;;     no-emacs path.  Returns (:ready t) or (:ready nil :missing
;;     (REASON ...)).
;;   - `nelisp-integration-cold-init-run' real coordinator that wires
;;     `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-run' (T12) and translates its plist into
;;     the Phase 7.5.2 status shape (briefing template).
;;   - `nelisp-integration-cold-init-smoke' multi-trial helper used by
;;     the Doc 32 v2 §7 success-rate gate (≥ 95% in 100 trials on the
;;     blocker class; this helper supports any trial count).
;;
;; Deferred to Phase 7.5.3:
;;   - stage-d-v2.0 release artifact verifier (cdylib symbol probe +
;;     SHA-256 checksum + GPG signature verification per §2.10).
;;   - actual MCP serve via the static-linked binary; today the
;;     coordinator simulates the cold-init protocol and bin/anvil
;;     falls back to host Emacs after a green coordinator run.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
;; Optional: this file is also loaded by the standalone runtime, which has no
;; Emacs underneath it to load `subr-x' from -- and does not need one.  Every
;; name the tree uses from it (string-empty-p, string-trim, string-blank-p,
;; when-let, if-let, hash-table-keys/-values) is already defined by the stdlib
;; prelude there; measured 2026-08-19, `fboundp' answers t for all of them in
;; the built reader.  A hard require asks for a file rather than for the
;; functions, and the file is the part that does not exist.

;;;; Phase 7.5.2 — scaffold-layer dispatcher + per-stage stubs
;;
;; The real coordinator (`nelisp-integration-cold-init-run' above)
;; delegates the four bootstrap stages to T12 `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-run',
;; which in turn requires the T13 `nelisp-runtime' binary to be on
;; disk.  Hosts without that binary (= release tarballs that ship only
;; `src/' + `bin/anvil', CI runners that skip `make runtime') cannot
;; exercise the real path.
;;
;; The scaffold-layer dispatcher below offers a strictly structural
;; alternative: a 4-stage harness that runs each stage through either
;; the *real* handler (when supplied via `:handlers' override) or a
;; clearly-marked stub handler that returns
;;   (:status :stub-not-yet-impl-pending-phase-X.Y :stage STAGE).
;; Production callers therefore cannot mistake a stub return for a
;; passing run — every stub status keyword starts with `:stub-' and
;; the dispatcher refuses to count a stub as completed (the
;; `:stages-completed' counter only advances on `pass').
;;
;; This separation lets Phase 7.5.2 ship the *contract* (= dispatcher
;; shape, error propagation, timing, soak harness) before Phase
;; 7.0-7.4 closure unblocks the real 4-stage embed.  The ERT layer
;; pins the contract so a future Phase 7.0-7.4 close cannot drift the
;; plist shape silently.

  "Phase 7.5.3 24h soak harness with real GC + RSS measurement.

ARGS is a plist:

                             with the scaffold defaults.
  :stop-on-fail BOOL       — stop the soak as soon as any iteration
                             returns a non-pass status (default nil so
                             the harness completes the full iteration

The function never raises; handler errors are captured into the
per-iteration result via `nelisp-integration--cold-init-run-stage'-style
condition-case wrapping inside the handler itself (the dispatcher
already handles this).

Real measurement notes:
  - GC delta = (`gcs-done' AFTER) - (`gcs-done' BEFORE) per iteration.
  - GC pause = (`gc-elapsed' AFTER) - (`gc-elapsed' BEFORE) per
    iteration (seconds, float).
  - RSS = `process-attributes' rss field × page size when available,
    or /proc/self/status VmRSS line as a Linux fallback; nil on
    platforms that expose neither (= `:rss-stats nil')."

VERSION defaults to `nelisp-integration-release-artifact-default-version'

matches the §11 blocker tier.  The verifier checks:

  1. `dist/' is present (= `make release-artifact' was at least
     attempted in this worktree).
  2. The tarball, .sha256, and .sig files all exist for the
     (version, platform) tuple.
  3. The recomputed SHA-256 of the tarball matches the value in
     the .sha256 file.
  4. The .sig file carries the documented ad-hoc payload for the
     correct (version, platform) tuple (Doc 32 v2 §2.5 placeholder

`:signature-platform-mismatch'.  The function never raises; on every
failure path it returns `:ready nil' with a populated `:missing' list
so bin/anvil callers can triage without a `condition-case' wrapper.

This is the Phase 7.5.3 prep entry point — the *real* GPG signature
verification + cdylib symbol probe land when v2.1 ships per Doc 32
v2 §8 / §2.5.  Until then the ad-hoc signature placeholder is the
only thing the verifier asserts on, and `--no-emacs' will not gate on
this verifier (the cold-init coordinator at §3.2 is the operative
gate).  Phase 7.5.3 wires the verifier into the release-artifact CI
matrix so a malformed tarball never reaches GitHub Releases."
