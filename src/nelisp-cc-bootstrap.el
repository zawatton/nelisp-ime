;; Phase 7.1.5 *self-host bootstrap scaffold* — see
;; docs/design/28-phase7.1-native-compiler.org §3.5.  Implements the
;; structural skeleton for the 4-stage A1 → A2 → A3 self-host protocol
;; over the Phase 7.1.4 simulator (`nelisp-cc-runtime'); real
;; mmap-PROT_EXEC execution and the actual 3-axis bench gate
;; (fib 30x / fact-iter 20x / alloc-heavy 5x) land in Phase 7.5.
;;
;; The four stages, mapped 1:1 onto the doc:
;;
;;   stage0  host Emacs (Stage D Phase 6.1 path) byte-compiles the
;;           source — the resulting .elc *is* A2's input bytecode and
;;           is fed (conceptually) to the bytecode VM that runs A2.
;;           Failure mode: host Emacs is unavailable → entire bootstrap
;;           halts with `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-error'.
;;
;;   stage1  A2 (= byte-compiled `nelisp-cc.el' running on the bytecode
;;           VM) native-compiles SOURCE-FILE through
;;           `nelisp-cc-runtime-compile-and-allocate' (T11 simulator
;;           pipeline).  Result = A3 *candidate*.  Failure mode: A3
;;           generation errors → bytecode path (A2) maintained as
;;           fallback, bootstrap returns :status fail with
;;           :fallback-active t.
;;
;;   stage2  A2 and the A3 candidate are fed the same set of TEST-INPUT
;;           expressions; the resulting `:final-bytes' vectors are
;;           compared by SHA-256.  Equal hash for every input ⇒ pass;
;;           otherwise stage2 fails, A3 candidate is rejected, and the
;;           A2 bytecode path remains authoritative.  This is the
;;           "golden hash" gate from §3.5 stage2.
;;
;;   stage3  The A3 candidate re-compiles SOURCE-FILE itself; the
;;           resulting bytes are hashed and compared against the A3
;;           candidate's own hash.  Equal ⇒ A3 promoted to authoritative
;;           (Rhodes target-2 cold-init analogue, §3.5 stage3); diff ⇒
;;           A3 rejected, A2 fallback maintained.
;;
;; Scope (this file, ~600 LOC):
;;
;;   - Stage 0/1/2/3 helpers + the umbrella entry point
;;     `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-run' which threads the four stages and
;;     returns a status plist with the per-stage hashes.
;;   - SHA-256 helpers (`secure-hash' wrapper that copes with
;;     vector / list / string byte stores) + a byte-level
;;     `--compare-bytes' that reports the first mismatch position.
;;
;; Out of scope (deferred to Phase 7.1.5 full implementation /
;; Phase 7.5):
;;
;;   - Real native code execution: stage1/stage3 use the Phase 7.1.4
;;     simulator pipeline, so the "execution" is structural only — the
;;     simulator records syscall traces but does not actually jump into
;;     the produced bytes.  Phase 7.5 wires the FFI bridge to the
;;     `nelisp-runtime/' Rust crate.
;;   - 3-axis bench gate measurement: `test/nelisp-cc-bench.el' ships
;;     three skip-unless-gated ERTs that document the API shape but
;;     skip cleanly until Phase 7.5 supplies real measurement.
;;   - Full NeLisp form coverage: the SSA frontend (T6) handles
;;     constants / `let' / `if' / direct calls today; full coverage
;;     (defun / while / setq) ships with the linear-scan spill+phi
;;     work that the runtime layer already deferred to Phase 7.1.5.
;;
;; Module convention (matches Phase 7.1.4):
;;   - `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-' = public API
;;   - `nelisp-cc-bootstrap--' = private helper
;;   - errors derive from `nelisp-cc-bootstrap-error', a sibling of
;;     `nelisp-cc-error'.

;; the `pcase' macro (and `pcase-let' / `pcase-let*'), kept in sync with
;; lisp/nelisp-pcase.el; measured 2026-08-19, `(fboundp 'pcase)' is t in the

;;
;; This is sufficient for the protocol skeleton: stage0 produces a
;; stable hash, stage1+ consume it, stage2 / stage3 verify against
;; their own hashes.  When the real .elc replaces the placeholder,
;; the consumer code at every stage needs no change because the
;; "hash + path-or-nil" cons stays shape-compatible.
